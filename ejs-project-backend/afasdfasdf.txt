The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly of India with uncommon speed and absence of irregularities between 1946 and 1949.[236] The Government of India Act 1935 was used as a model and framework.[236] Long passages from the Act were included. The constitution describes a federal state with a parliamentary system of democracy.[236] The federal structure was conspicuous for the strength of the central government, which exclusively exercised control of defence, foreign affairs, railways, ports, and currency.[236] The President, the constitutional head of government, has reserve powers for taking over the administration of a state.[236] The central legislature has two houses: the Lok Sabha, whose delegates are directly elected by the people in general elections every five years, and the Rajya Sabha, whose members are nominated by the elected representatives in the states.[236] There are also features not to be found in the Act of 1935. The definition of fundamental rights is based on the Constitution of the United States, and the constitutional directives, or goals of endeavor, are based on the Constitution of Ireland.[237] An Indian institution recommended by the constitution is the panchayat or village committees.[237] Untouchability is illegal (Article 17) and caste distinctions are derecognized (Articles 15(2) and 16(2)).[237] The promulgation of the Indian constitution transformed India into a republic within the Commonwealth.[237]

The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[238] Appointed by the president,[239] the prime minister is supported by the party or political alliance with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[238] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[240] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[241]
